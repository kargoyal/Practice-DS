    "doc1 = \"\"\"To install additional data tables for lemmatization in spaCy v2.2+ you can run pip install spacy[lookups] or install spacy-lookups-data separately. The lookups package is needed to create blank models with lemmatization data, and to lemmatize in languages that don’t yet come with pretrained models and aren’t powered by third-party libraries.The other way to install spaCy is to clone its GitHub repository and build it from source. That is the common way if you want to make changes to the code base. You’ll need to make sure that you have a development environment consisting of a Python distribution including header files, a compiler, pip, virtualenv and git installed. The compiler part is the trickiest. How to do that depends on your system. See notes on Ubuntu, macOS / OS X and Windows for details.\n",
    "As of v2.0, spaCy comes with neural network models that are implemented in our machine learning library, Thinc. For GPU support, we’ve been grateful to use the work of Chainer’s CuPy module, which provides a numpy-compatible interface for GPU arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy can be installed on GPU by specifying spacy[cuda], spacy[cuda90], spacy[cuda91], spacy[cuda92] or spacy[cuda100]. If you know your cuda version, using the more explicit specifier allows cupy to be installed via wheel, saving some compilation time. The specifiers should install cupy.\"\"\""
